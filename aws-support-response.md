Hi Isaac,

Thank you for your assistance with our Bedrock quota increase request. 
We have just implemented comprehensive logging and metrics collection to provide you with accurate data for our request:

1. We have set up dedicated S3 buckets for capturing all model invocation data:
   - Standard logs bucket (`bedrock-logs-mcp`) for regular invocations
   - Large data bucket (`bedrock-large-data-mcp`) for payloads exceeding 100KB

2. We've enabled detailed CloudWatch metrics collection for:
   - RPM and TPM tracking
   - Token usage patterns
   - Throttling events
   - Cross-region performance metrics

3. We have implemented automated analytics to gather:
   - Average token counts (input/output)
   - Request frequency patterns
   - Large token request percentages
   - Regional distribution data

We will be collecting metrics for the next 24 hours to provide you with comprehensive data for our quota increase request. This will include:
- Peak and steady-state usage patterns
- Detailed token utilization
- Cross-region inference performance
- Impact of current throttling on our workloads

Regarding your question about cross-region inference: Yes, we are already utilizing cross-region inference between us-east-1 and us-west-2. However, we're still experiencing throttling issues even with this configuration. We've set up our logging infrastructure in us-west-2 and will be tracking metrics across both regions to provide you with:

1. Region-specific performance data
2. Cross-region inference impact analysis
3. Comparative throttling metrics between regions
4. End-to-end latency measurements for cross-region requests

We expect to have all the requested information, with supporting metrics from both regions, ready for you within 24 hours. This will include separate statistics for each model we're requesting increases for, specifically:
- anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0
- anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0
- anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0

Our metrics will include both direct regional usage and cross-region inference patterns to provide a complete picture of our needs and current limitations.

In the meantime, if you need any specific metrics or additional information, please let us know.

Best regards,
Martin
